# About Me
I am a robotics PhD student in the [SHARE Lab](https://osusharelab.com/) at Oregon State University researching socially assistive robotics. I have previous degrees in nuclear engineering and robotics from Oregon State University, University of Wisconsin-Madison, and Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Additionally, I spent 5 years at Framatome where I designed nuclear fuel, smart cranes, and robots for nuclear reactors.
